## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I was able to use a lot of Flexbox in this project.


```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}
```


### Continued development

I'll try to learn a better way to understand those tools, and I'll add frameworks.
